## Laboratory Activity #2: Data Cleaning and Analysis using Titanic dataset

## Objectives:
- Apply the four pillars of computational thinking: Decomposition, Pattern Recognition, Abstraction, and Algorithm Design
- Analyze the Titanic dataset to identify key insights and stories of the data.

## Instructions:
Refer to the Data_Cleaning_Visualization_Titanic_Lab.pdf. Answer the questions below and write your answers into the Jupyter notebook via Google Colaboratory.

## QUESTIONS:
1. What are your steps in cleaning the dataset? Why did you choose the algorithm that you used in cleaning the dataset? 
2. Create at least two (2) basic data analysis on two (2) columns in the dataset. Be creative and critical in deriving the insights on the data. You can show the visualization used to derive the insights.
