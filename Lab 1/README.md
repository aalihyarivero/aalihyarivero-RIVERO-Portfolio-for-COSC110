## Laboratory Activity 1

## Objectives:
- Apply the four pillars of computational thinking: Decomposition, Pattern Recognition, Abstraction, and Algorithm Design
- Analyze the Titanic dataset to identify key insights and stories of the data.

## Instructions:
1. Refer to the Computational_Thinking_Titanic_Lab.pdf. Answer the questions in the file and put the answers in a Jupyter notebook via Google Colaboratory.
2. Use the train.csv (see attached) as our main Titanic dataset
3. Use the attached guides and sample output for your reference.
- For the sample output, you can make a copy of the notebook by going to File > Save a Copy in Drive
